# Introduction

## Marion Estelle Edison Oeser Biography

Mary and Thomas Edison's first child was Marion Estelle, born on February 18, 1873. As a child, her nickname was "Dot," a reference to the Morse code used to send messages on telegraphs. Between her mother's death and her father's remarriage, 12-year-old Marion spent a great deal of time with her father. He even sent her out to buy his cigars. She claims to have seen Edison propose marriage to Mina Miller using Morse code. Marion boarded at Somerville Seminary in Somerville, New Jersey, and Bradford Academy in Bradford, Massachusetts. In 1895 she married Karl Oscar Oeser, a German army lieutenant, and lived in Germany even through the First World War. Although she described her marriage as "one long drawn out honeymoon," it ended in divorce in 1921. She then returned to the United States, where she died on April 16, 1965. [^2]

## Marion Estelle Edison Oeser During World War I

The letters also contain extensive discussion of social, political, and economic conditions in Germany during World War I and the years immediately following. Here she discusses a change made by French newspapers that show Germans as more threatening than they are. Below the first image, she writes *The original picture printed in a German paper. Sandweiler (?) soldiers looking at the women washing."* Below the second image, she writes *The same picture changed by the French. No wonder that people think the Germans are brutes.*

This is a letter from Marion to her father and Mina, written in German. A transcription is below. 
*“English letters are not being forwarded during the war, but I did not want to leave you without news. I am sure someone will easily be found who might translate these few lines of mine to you. A terrible era has commenced one really shudders thinking of what else may be happening. What we have experienced so far is enough already. Officers told us that French soldiers stabbed the eyes of the German wounded. The aviators report that part of Mulhouen are lodging in ruins. Where Oskar is I do not know. Whether our house is still standing, I know just a little. There will be unspeakable misery for years to come. I came here 10 days ago in a terrible night. Oskar brought me here in an Auto, and I am rather safe now. For this reason. There are a great number of Red Cross hospitals here. I suppose I..."* (continued on page 2)

Continued from page 1
*"...will have many terrible experiences. The first days I was here, I cried almost all the time, for I did not know anybody and was in grave fear. I don’t feel as lonesome anymore now, because there are now a few officers I know, training the new soldiers. The Germans are a wonderful race. Officers as well as soldiers are burning from eagerness to face the enemy. One man asked to be released that he might return to his regiment and take part in the battle. With such enthusiasm Germany will come out victorious. Napoleon is said to have owed his entire success to the fact, that he knew how to kindle the enthusiasm of his soldiers. Letters from Amerika do not arrive. I hope you are all well and in good health"*

## William Leslie Edison Biography

William Leslie was born on October 26, 1878. Like his older brother, William boarded at St. Paul's School, Concord, New Hampshire, and the J.M. Hawkins School on Staten Island. He later studied at the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale. He married Blanche Travers. He served in the military during the Spanish-American War in 1898 and again in the First World War (though he wrote his father in 1918 in a failed attempt to get a discharge). Relations between William and his father were strained. Edison once responded to a request for money from Blanche Edison by writing, "I see no reason whatever why I should support my son. He has done me no honor and has brought the blush of shame to my cheeks many times." Like his brother he turned to farm life, breeding chickens. He died on August 10, 1937.[^4]
