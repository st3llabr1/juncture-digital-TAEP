The following is a list prepared by Edison's personal assistant William H. Meadowcroft, of 57 wartime research experiments, along with another list of 48 experiments. This is a similar list to the one contained in Chapter 11 of Scott's book.

Below are some examples of Edison's research experiments for the Naval Consultancy Board, mentioned in Scott's book. The links on the page numbers lead to the appropriate page in the Hathi Trust version of Scott's book. Two projects—Sailing Lights for Convoys (pp.175-176) and Steamship Decoys (p.180)—do not have related documents in the Hummel Collection. The links for those projects lead only to the Scott book.

## Edison, Submarines, and the Phonograph

Edison was responsible for many innovations for the war effort, including the home front. This is a recording from an Edison Diamond Disc of a dramatized submarine attack on a US cargo ship.[^1]
