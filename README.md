The maps are folded into the book and were only partially scanned by Google. For an Adobe Acrobat version of the selected pages, [click here](http://edison.rutgers.edu/Scott.pdf).


The following is a list of research projects discussed in Chapter 11. The link on each project description leads to a folder of original documents related to that project in the [Charles Hummel Collection: Edison Wartime Research Reports](https://edisondigital.rutgers.edu/folder/X128C). In cases where there are several folders of original documents pertaining to a project, the link leads to the first folder in the numbered sequence. References to other folders containing documents relevant to a particular project appear in the descriptive notes introducing each folder.

The links on the page numbers lead to the appropriate page in the Hathi Trust version of Scott's book. Two projects—Sailing Lights for Convoys (pp.175-176) and Steamship Decoys (p.180)—do not have related documents in the Hummel Collection. The links for those projects lead only to the Scott book.


## Edison, Submarines, and the Phonograph

Edison was responsible for creating technology to identify submarines, but his phonograph discs were also used to help people at home understand the war. This is a recording of a dramatized submarine attack on a US cargo ship.
