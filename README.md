(3) Appendix: Naval Laboratory, which contains the [majority report](https://edisondigital.rutgers.edu/document/X128D225) signed by Frank J. Sprague and Lawrence Addicks recommending Annapolis as the site of the proposed laboratory and the [minority report](https://edisondigital.rutgers.edu/document/X128D230) signed by Edison recommending Sandy Hook, New Jersey. Another appendix (not selected) contains thirty oversize maps of shipping routes along the coasts of Europe and North America, prepared by Edison and included in his letter to Geddes.

The maps are folded into the book and were only partially scanned by Google. For an Adobe Acrobat version of the selected pages, [click here](http://edison.rutgers.edu/Scott.pdf).


The following is a list of research projects discussed in Chapter 11. The link on each project description leads to a folder of original documents related to that project in the [Charles Hummel Collection: Edison Wartime Research Reports](https://edisondigital.rutgers.edu/folder/X128C). In cases where there are several folders of original documents pertaining to a project, the link leads to the first folder in the numbered sequence. References to other folders containing documents relevant to a particular project appear in the descriptive notes introducing each folder.

The links on the page numbers lead to the appropriate page in the Hathi Trust version of Scott's book. Two projects—Sailing Lights for Convoys (pp.175-176) and Steamship Decoys (p.180)—do not have related documents in the Hummel Collection. The links for those projects lead only to the Scott book.
