# History & Mission of The Edison Papers Project

The mission of the Thomas A. Edison Papers Project is to make “the documentary legacy of America’s most prolific inventor and innovator accessible through selective, annotated digital image and book editions. In addition, we disseminate our research through journal and book publications, conference papers, information on our website, media appearances, public lectures, museum collaborations, and educational programs.” The project is divided into five parts: the digital edition, the book edition, the microfilm collection, the motion picture catalogs, and Edison Miller Family records. The nine volumes of the book edition have been completed; with the tenth forthcoming. The first edition was published in 1989 and most recently  in 2021. They are available to read on Project Muse, covering the years 1847-1889. The book edition has been compiled and edited by scholars of Edison, including Dr. Israel, the current director of the project. The motion picture catalogs are developed from the print guide, published in 1985, and while there are PDFs for the different catalogs, they are hosted on RUCore through Rutgers Libraries, rather than on the Edison digital edition site. The digital edition team is in the process of creating new catalog records and updating the website to include these catalogs.

# Current Project & Internship Responsibiliites 

The current project is led by Dr. Paul Israel, who was part of the reorganization in the 1970s, and under his direction, 227 reels of microfilm have been published (about ⅓ of a million pages), completed in the 1980s. This includes: technical, business, and personal papers, covering the years 1847-1910; a collection of film and equipment catalogs from the early years of motion pictures. The current digital edition has a searchable database with document images, from the original collection, and includes other material from outside repositories. The purpose of this project is to make the works of Edison accessible through “selective, annotated, digital image and book edition.”

Completed in 2008, the corresponding collections have been uploaded to the Internet Archive as a repository for the digital site. Most of these documents were taken from the archive at Thomas Edison National Historical Park in West Orange, New Jersey. This collection also includes documents from over a hundred outside repositories, both public and private collections. The next step in the digital edition process is to create a sub-site that focuses specifically on Edison’s notebooks, called the Notebook Collection, which can help researchers to focus on smaller subsets of this enormous collection.
