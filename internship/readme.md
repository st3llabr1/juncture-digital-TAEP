# Internship Introduction & About this Page

The essay below reviews the work I completed for my internship, presented in the digital format I researched, prototyped, and presented to the Edison Papers Project team. This visual essay tool, called Juncture, will serve as one of the tools used for future exhibitions at the Edison Papers project. It best represents my experience, as it reflects my personal, academic, and employment interests in digital humanities; the flexibility and encouragement I recevied from my team; and the perserverance and learning I developed throughout the semester. There are various features within the essay to explore.

- Links to websites, indicated by an underline, and blue arrow

# History & Mission of The Edison Papers Project

The mission of the [Thomas A. Edison Papers Project](https://edison.rutgers.edu/) is to make “the documentary legacy of America’s most prolific inventor and innovator accessible through selective, annotated digital image and book editions. In addition, we disseminate our research through journal and book publications, conference papers, information on our website, media appearances, public lectures, museum collaborations, and educational programs.”[^1] The project is divided into five parts: the digital edition, the book edition, the microfilm collection, the motion picture catalogs, and Edison Miller Family records. The nine volumes of the book edition have been completed; with the tenth forthcoming. The first edition was published in 1989 and most recently  in 2021. The book edition has been compiled and edited by scholars of Edison, including [Dr. Paul Israel](https://edison.rutgers.edu/about/staff?view=article&id=307:paul-israel&catid=28), the current director of the project. The digital edition team is in the process of creating new catalog records and updating the website to include these catalogs.

# Current Project & Internship Responsibiliites 

The current project is led by Dr. Paul Israel, who was part of the reorganization in the 1970s, and under his direction, 227 reels of microfilm have been published (about ⅓ of a million pages), completed in the 1980s. This includes: technical, business, and personal papers, covering the years 1847-1910; a collection of film and equipment catalogs from the early years of motion pictures. The current [Digital Edition](https://edisondigital.rutgers.edu/) has a searchable database with document images, from the original collection, and includes other material from over a hundred outside repositories, representing public and private collections. The next step in the digital edition process is to create a sub-site that focuses specifically on Edison’s notebooks, called the Notebook Collection, which can help researchers to focus on smaller subsets of this enormous collection. The current project is funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Archives. It has several components.  Most recently, all the reels with notebooks were uploaded to the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/search.php?query=subject%3A%22EdisonNotebook%22&and[]=subject%3A%22Thomas+A.+Edison+Papers%22), as a digital repository.

## Responsibilities

My original tasks for the semester were to focus on: metadata management, manipulation, and production; digital image processing and indexing; and finding aids. I will also take part in constructing a new exhibit, based on a currently unpublished collection of Edison’s Pocket Notebooks. For this project, I moved through the various stages of processing, publication, and metadata production to create an exhibit. While I did process the unpublished collection, I did not turn it into an exhibition, an instead made an exhibit based on Edison's son and daughter's activities during World War I. We decided that I would work on the motion picture catalogs and patent collection in the fall. 

The tasks and deliverables we had identified were:
- Create motion picture catalog records in Omeka-S that point to the RUcore objects (delayed to FALL 2022)
- Create an Archive.org collection for patent PDFs, then create catalog records in Omeka-S that point to the Archive.org object (delayed to FALL 2022)
- Produce 23 pocket notebook PDFs, publish to Archive.org Notebooks collection, then add to Omeka-S notebooks sub-site (COMPLETE)
- Produce exhibit of the new pocket notebook collection; more like a finding aid or book report, with links to related documents / searches in Digital Edition (COMPLETE)
- Explore use of IIIF and linked data to merge metadata, digital objects + exhibit information (COMPLETE)

# Themes of the Internship

My internship had three themes: neutrality, flexibility, and connections. Each of these themes are explored below.

## Neutrality

The Edison Papers Project is an example of documentary editing, which is different than critical, or scholarly editing. What differentiates these two disciplines, is that documentary editing makes more of an effort to be “neutral,” though that has been challenged significantly in the past few decades. The collected papers of important American figures have shifted over time to include not just the biographical and the psychological, but to include social, political, and economic factors in contextualizing the documents of these figures.  The scholarly journal [Scholarly Editing: The Annual of the Association of Documentary Editing](https://scholarlyediting.org/issues/39/), represents this shift. The first iteration of the publication was divided into three parts: editions, essays, and reviews. The editions section focuses on specific historical collections, and the essays about them engage with the primary source material, discussing the author’s use of the material, or their experience with it. The journal took a five year hiatus, from 2017 to 2022, and the most recent edition has a much more specific and thematic organization: Microeditions, Voices and Perspectives: Interviews and Conversations, Uncovering and Sustaining the Cultural Record, Essays, Pedagogy and Scholarly Editing, and Reviews. This reorganization is much more lively and engaging, and the titles of the articles appear to follow trends in other GLAM institutions: racial and social justice, inclusivity, and amplifying previously silenced voices. The authors write that they are “actively seeking to dislodge the single-author model, oral histories and tales, community recovery, creative works of ‘rememory,’ and the decolonizing of artistic works, archives, records, and editions for the discoverability of racialized and underrepresented stories and cultural artifacts”[^2]

#### Reflection

During the spring semester I thought, and wrote, a lot about neutrality in the archives, specifically the ways in which archives are not neutral; and neither are these documents of Edison’s. But what I find interesting, in my internship, is that we talk about these documents like data points, we never really discuss anything about the content of the documents. We could be talking about anything, anyone’s papers; it’s an image, or a web address, or some text. I get the feeling that, not that its bad or good, that it’s not really our business what it says, or how it might be used, or is being used, except in broad terms like “searchable” and “findable.” I say this because I can see how easily someone can become neutral about archives, how being overwhelmed with the organization and the factual, or meta-factual, the actual people, whether in the archives, or those stewarding them, become lost. In the last semester, I felt that I wanted to be more of an activist in advocating for people who had been silenced, or left out of the archives. But my experience with the Edison Papers has shown me how easy it is to be neutral, not because it isn't valuable, but because the amount of information you are dealing with is overwhelming, or basically, your job doesn't involve anything that would allow you opportunity to address it. I think that this is a good counter to my activist archivist rage of the previous semester, not that I will lose sight of the human value of archives, but to learn the dynamics of these types of disciplines and professions. Through my reading of the Scholarly Editing Journal, I was very encouraged about the discipline-wide acceptance of these important social justice issues.

## Flexibility & Adaptation

I selected this internship because I really wanted to be a part of the history and future of this archive. The scope and breadth of this project, as well as its long history, was attractive to me because we have to contend with previous iterations of current technology. The microfilmed documents have created unique problems in creating a digital website that is accessible, and easy to find. Whereas some ADE projects are in the process of scanning documents into digital formats, the Edison Papers Project, had to create digital versions of microfilm, and then edit and create new metadata. Additionally, there was another website, the legacy edition, and that was recently migrated to the new digital edition site. In a lot of ways, this project is also the history of the ways archives have had to adapt and shift to make their collections more accessible. I appreciate that sense of history, and the complex work being done for the purposes of discoverability and accessibility, using the tech available over the past fifty years. I really love the complexity of this project, all its moving parts, and the way it has to contend with the ways people have tried to organize and shape this massive amount of archival material. Because this project is so large, and still in the process of being digitized, there are lots of opportunities for learning about metadata. I'm learning about different metadata standards, and how they work with the different collections. I also have the opportunity to work on exhibits, and use IIIF functionality to create accessibility. While my focus in the program is Archives and Preservation, and this collection is technically an archive, it is run by a historian and people from the digital humanities field. 

#### Reflection

My project, determined at the beginning of the semester, should span the entire work process of the Edison Paper, from unprocessed material to digitally enabled exhibit. However, once I had processed the material, it was unclear how I would address the contents of these objects (they were personal, pocket notebooks that contained Edison’s day-to-day thoughts), without being an Edison scholar. In the meantime, I had reviewed some presentations from a recent IIIF conference that the digital manager had attended, and was really impressed by a tool called Juncture, developed by JSTOR labs. I spoke to Ben, and he was really excited about the Juncture tool. So I had a meeting with Paul and Nicole (the exhibits manager) and presented the Juncture tool. We also discussed the role of the pocket notebook collection, and how it was difficult to determine how an exhibit might be created from it. I felt it was very important that my work contribute to the overall project of the Edison papers, even in a small way, because it seemed a waste of time to do anything else. However, without a lot of knowledge of Edison, that was becoming difficult. Through our discussion, we decided that it would be best to use existing essays about Edison and World War I<span data-click-image-zoomto="22,135,568,411">, because I’m interested in World War I, and create an exhibit using the Juncture tool. So instead of creating an exhibit from the pocket notebooks, I would complete a different exhibit, which still allowed me to complete all the steps of a project, even though the beginning material was not related to the final product. I really appreciated the flexibility of Ben and Paul, and that they wanted me to research and follow up on my own interests, rather than staying on a track that was more difficult, even though we had identified it as the goal of the internship. There is a really good balance of teaching and learning, flexibility and goal-oriented practices in this internship. It has really felt good to be included and to have my ideas listened to and felt part of the project as a whole.

# Connections

## ITHAKA & JSTOR in New York, USA

I met with Ron Snyder at JSTOR to discuss the Juncture tool he developed, as a way to create visual essays. Here is an example of what [it can do:] (https://lab.plant-humanities.org/). Most of the examples are pictorial, and the Edison Papers works mostly with images of text, and I explained that we would like to use the features provided by Juncture to highlight certain parts of the text, and collect different parts of Edison’s documents together into one exhibit, based on a theme or time period. Because there are so many documents, it is definitely daunting, but it also has the ability to be iterative, and exhibits (and its contents) can be shifted to accommodate new information or perspectives. Exhibits through Juncture would also show the use of archival material in developing a historical essay.  This is just the first step in developing this exhibit, as the letters could be connected/contrasted with other experiences and documents from outside the Edison Papers. They could also be adjusted to include more perspectives, as they became available.

## The Royal Society in London, England

Through a connection from Ben, I met with a colleague of his, who he had met through the IIIF conference, on Friday. Dr. Anne McLaughlin has a PhD from the Warburg Institute, and a Master’s degree in Medieval Studies from Oxford.  She has worked for a few of the libraries at schools she attended,, and the National Gallery. She currently works on Science in the Making, a digital project with the Royal Society. She took me on a tour of the building, which is right off the Mall that leads to Buckingham Palace, and the reading room. She mentioned that when she was first hired for her job, she did not have really any knowledge of coding or digital tools, but learned everything on the job. When we discussed how it is difficult for MI (or MLIS) programs to focus on digital programs, she explained that each archive/library/special collections uses different naming conventions, different systems, and that even if it were to be taught, it would either be obsolete within a couple of years, or it would be too difficult to cover all the possibilities of software or skills that are needed for every possible job. Another topic we discussed was sort of the arbitrary divisions between libraries, archives, and special collections, and that while you may have a specific title, you may be participating in activities and providing services that would fall under those other job types.

#### Reflection
Overall, I was very excited to meet with him. In part because it was such a good meeting that suggested further collaboration with the Edison Papers, but also personally because I have known about JSTOR for so long, and felt a kind of connection to them. I know that seems strange, but in my research (which was English and Humanities based) I always found the best articles on JSTOR. Maybe less of a connection, and more of a familiarity. I really like the idea of a lean and flexible way of providing access to archival material. During the discussion with Ron, he demoed the next version which requires even less coding experience, and would allow someone to make shifts in an exhibit very easily and quickly. It was also encouraging to hear someone who started with very little skill (digitally) to have made her way in a digital role, as a project manager. I think that has been one of my main concerns, for the program, and the internship: that I don’t know enough, and I need to know more. When I talked to Ben, I said that I should have researched more, and practiced more coding-type things. But as Anne said, there’s no way to really prepare for more digital skills. I think we settled on, “you look at it again, and again, and again, and again, and you mess with it, see what it does, change it, and over time, you learn something about it.”  I also shared with her some of the issues I was having with the exhibit project I’ve been working on, and she shared some solutions, some of which I had explored, but was missing one small piece to make it work. It felt reassuring to know that I was on the right path to answering my questions.

# Concluding Thoughts

I really, really love my internship and I feel the best advice I could give is focused on understanding yourself and your preferences, while valuing your time and experience. It’s helpful to know what kind of working situation you prefer. For example, do you prefer to set your own schedule, or do you need someone to give you structure? Do you like to explore answers on your own, or do you want the answer from a person with more experience? Although you won’t always know the full extent of a company/organization’s culture, you can know what is the best working environment for yourself, and you can let them know how you work best, to see if it’s a good fit. 

I also think there is an implied power difference in an internship. Sometimes, an intern feels “lucky” to have landed an internship, and feels they must work above and beyond what is asked. And while I do feel lucky to have this internship, it doesn’t mean that the organization is not greatly benefiting from my unpaid and passionate labor. I don’t mean that you shouldn’t take every opportunity to learn. I think it’s a mindset, a perspective I’ve had to remind myself of recently: that my work and perspective is valuable on its own, not just in being recognized by someone else.  I haven’t felt taken advantage of at all, during this internship; I have been  encouraged at every step, and because I was in that place of confidence and security that I’ve been able to reflect on the value of my contributions to the project. And not just simply telling myself “this was good” or even more simply, “no one had a problem with this,” it was also the qualities and gradations of good. What were the strengths, what were the weaknesses, and why were they there? Is it a skill that needed honing? Or was it just a really busy week?  I believe it’s important to value yourself and your contributions, and that the company/organization is benefitting from you and your (free) work and perspective. 

Most importantly, I would tell someone that the point of the internship is to learn, not to know. You aren’t (or shouldn’t be) expected to know how to do something, that’s why you are in an internship, and not a job. In my job at an art gallery, we were going to take on an intern from an art school, and she gave us the contract from her school, and one part really stood out. Paraphrased, it said that daily work should be impacted by the presence of the intern, things should go slower, because you are taking the time to teach and interact with the intern so that they can learn and reflect on their work experience. That same concept was reinforced many times during the past few months, and I think that’s a crucial dynamic to be aware of during an internship. When I felt that what I was doing had to be perfect, I reminded myself that I was learning, and it was okay to have mistakes and to improve on earlier work.
