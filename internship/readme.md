# History & Mission of The Edison Papers Project

The mission of the Thomas A. Edison Papers Project is to make “the documentary legacy of America’s most prolific inventor and innovator accessible through selective, annotated digital image and book editions. In addition, we disseminate our research through journal and book publications, conference papers, information on our website, media appearances, public lectures, museum collaborations, and educational programs.” The project is divided into five parts: the digital edition, the book edition, the microfilm collection, the motion picture catalogs, and Edison Miller Family records. The nine volumes of the book edition have been completed; with the tenth forthcoming. The first edition was published in 1989 and most recently  in 2021. They are available to read on Project Muse, covering the years 1847-1889. The book edition has been compiled and edited by scholars of Edison, including Dr. Israel, the current director of the project. The motion picture catalogs are developed from the print guide, published in 1985, and while there are PDFs for the different catalogs, they are hosted on RUCore through Rutgers Libraries, rather than on the Edison digital edition site. The digital edition team is in the process of creating new catalog records and updating the website to include these catalogs.

# Current Project & Internship Responsibiliites 

The current project is led by Dr. Paul Israel, who was part of the reorganization in the 1970s, and under his direction, 227 reels of microfilm have been published (about ⅓ of a million pages), completed in the 1980s. This includes: technical, business, and personal papers, covering the years 1847-1910; a collection of film and equipment catalogs from the early years of motion pictures. The current digital edition has a searchable database with document images, from the original collection, and includes other material from outside repositories. The purpose of this project is to make the works of Edison accessible through “selective, annotated, digital image and book edition.”

Completed in 2008, the corresponding collections have been uploaded to the Internet Archive as a repository for the digital site. Most of these documents were taken from the archive at Thomas Edison National Historical Park in West Orange, New Jersey. This collection also includes documents from over a hundred outside repositories, both public and private collections. The next step in the digital edition process is to create a sub-site that focuses specifically on Edison’s notebooks, called the Notebook Collection, which can help researchers to focus on smaller subsets of this enormous collection.

The current project is funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Archives. It has several components.  Most recently, all the reels with notebooks were uploaded to archive.org, the Internet Archive, as a digital repository. We are now in the process of transferring the notebooks from the digital edition site to a new Omeka-S subsite, which will include a virtual reading room, and integrate the Internet Archive viewer. Additionally, images from the microfilm are processed and then mapped to document identifiers before being uploaded to the digital edition. These are the major components of the project, however, there are smaller parts such as: transcription of documents, developing exhibits, finding aids, series notes, and an integrated digital edition. The overall goal is to fully publish all parts of the notebook collection, include links to each archive.org document, and to provide an accessible collection with transcriptions, reading room, and new exhibits. 

## Responsibilities

My tasks for the semester will focus on: metadata management, manipulation, and production; digital image processing and indexing; and finding aids. I will also take part in constructing a new exhibit, based on a currently unpublished collection of Edison’s Pocket Notebooks. For this project, I will move through the various stages of processing, publication, and metadata production to create an exhibit. 

The tasks and deliverables we identified are:
- Create motion picture catalog records in Omeka-S that point to the RUcore objects
- Create an Archive.org collection for patent PDFs, then create catalog records in Omeka-S that point to the Archive.org object
- Produce 23 pocket notebook PDFs (Monica will train), publish to Archive.org Notebooks collection, then add to Omeka-S notebooks sub-site
- Produce exhibit of the new pocket notebook collection (more like a finding aid or book report, with links to related documents / searches in Digital Edition)
- Explore use of IIIF and linked data to merge metadata, digital objects + exhibit information

## Connections

However, I would like to share that I was able to have a meeting with a developer from ITHAKA, a non-profit group that owns JSTOR, ARTSTOR and others, and is focused on increasing access to educational tools and resources, as well as providing a way to preserve digital materials. They are also committed to helping underrepresented students access higher education. I have known about JSTOR since I was in undergrad, and used their digital repository as far back as 2002. During the last semester, I completed a term paper for Dr. Dalbello that analyzed the user experience of navigating digitized copies of feminist ‘zines from the 1970s. The project that provided the digitization, use, and storage of these ‘zines, among about 70 others, was Reveal Digital, which is another component of ITHAKA.

I met with Ron Snyder to discuss the Juncture tool he developed, as a way to create visual essays. Here is an example of what it can do: https://lab.plant-humanities.org/. Most of the examples are pictorial, and the Edison Papers works mostly with images of text, and I explained that we would like to use the features provided by Juncture to highlight certain parts of the text, and collect different parts of Edison’s documents together into one exhibit, based on a theme or time period. Because there are so many documents, it is definitely daunting, but it also has the ability to be iterative, and exhibits (and its contents) can be shifted to accommodate new information or perspectives. Exhibits through Juncture would also show the use of archival material in developing a historical essay. For example, the exhibit I’m working on is letters from Marion (Edison’s first daughter) and William (Edison’s second son) to Edison and Mina (Edison’s wife). The series notes explain that these letters explore the  mental and emotional state, as well as discussing the political and social climate during the war. I found letters that exemplify those perspectives, and I use the tool to highlight that information in the letters. 

This is just the first step in developing this exhibit, as the letters could be connected/contrasted with other experiences and documents from outside the Edison Papers. They could also be adjusted to include more perspectives, as they became available. I really like this potential capability, because I have been doing research about community and participatory archives in preparation for the British Manuscripts and Archives course, and a recurring point is the static and opaque nature of finding aids and archival description. I realize that this is due to a backlog of material that has yet to be processed, and that time and need are required to go back and change descriptions or finding aids based on new information or perspectives; it is however, exciting to think about how it could be done, if intuitive tools and different priorities were implemented. Leaving the critique of professional and institutional archives’ workflow aside, I really like the idea of a lean and flexible way of providing access to archival material. During the discussion with Ron, he demoed the next version which requires even less coding experience, and would allow someone to make shifts in an exhibit very easily and quickly. 

Overall, I was very excited to meet with him. In part because it was such a good meeting that suggested further collaboration with the Edison Papers, but also personally because I have known about JSTOR for so long, and felt a kind of connection to them. I know that seems strange, but in my research (which was English and Humanities based) I always found the best articles on JSTOR. Maybe less of a connection, and more of a familiarity. So overall, it has been a really encouraging and exciting week. 

This weekend I traveled to London in preparation for the British Manuscripts and Archives course. Through a connection from Ben, I met with a colleague of his, who he had met through the IIIF conference, on Friday. Dr. Anne McLaughlin has a PhD from the Warburg Institute, and a Master’s degree in Medieval Studies from Oxford. She did her undergraduate degree in the US at Gaucher College, in Art History. She has worked for a few of the libraries at schools she attended,, and the National Gallery. She currently works on Science in the Making, a digital project with the Royal Society. She took me on a tour of the building, which is right off the Mall that leads to Buckingham Palace, and the reading room. It was beautiful, but also practical, being converted from one palatial townhouse. 

We discussed many things, some of which are fuzzy, as I arrived on the 6am flight that same morning. But a few things were very memorable. She mentioned that when she was first hired for her job, she did not have really any knowledge of coding or digital tools, but learned everything on the job. When we discussed how it is difficult for MI (or MLIS) programs to focus on digital programs, she explained that each archive/library/special collections uses different naming conventions, different systems, and that even if it were to be taught, it would either be obsolete within a couple of years, or it would be too difficult to cover all the possibilities of software or skills that are needed for every possible job. It was also encouraging to hear someone who started with very little skill (digitally) to have made her way in a digital role, as a project manager. I think that has been one of my main concerns, for the program, and the internship: that I don’t know enough, and I need to know more. When I talked to Ben two weeks ago, I said that I should have researched more, and practiced more coding-type things. But as Anne said, there’s no way to really prepare for more digital skills. I think we settled on, “you look at it again, and again, and again, and again, and you mess with it, see what it does, change it, and over time, you learn something about it.”  I also shared with her some of the issues I was having with the exhibit project I’ve been working on, and she shared some solutions, some of which I had explored, but was missing one small piece to make it work. It felt reassuring to know that I was on the right path to answering my questions.

Another topic we discussed was sort of the arbitrary divisions between libraries, archives, and special collections, and that while you may have a specific title, you may be participating in activities and providing services that would fall under those other job types. I think maybe the exception to this is a job with a title like “processing archivist” or “acquisitions archivist” which orient to a specific activity within the archiving process. She also explained that she had encountered many archivists that were specialists in a time period, and were experts at contextualizing documents from specific eras or areas. This made me reflect on a reading from Dr. Dalbello’s Foundations of Archives and Preservation course on Archival Reference Knowledge, which looked at what should be expected from archives courses and programs. At the time, I didn’t understand the depth of what might be expected from a reference archivist, or an archivist that specialized in a particular area. I feel like that archivist would also have to have a very deep understanding of that period, educated to a master’s level at least. However, the research showed that content-area knowledge was not as needed in job descriptions, and was not emphasized in either training or educational programs. Perhaps Anne’s perspective is a reflection of her academic background, as a medievalist and art historian, and the jobs she has held. It also could be a reflection of one of the divisions between American and British archival science. But to return to my original point, it is encouraging to know that the job market may be wider than I originally thought (which I had already thought about, based on one of your comments to an earlier journal). I am also getting a lot of opportunities to explore digital tools and develop digital skills through The Edison Papers, and will be continuing that into the next few semesters as a graduate intern (for pay). This internship has been, on so many levels, so helpful and valuable to me. I think I’m excited to learn more about not only the skills required to be a part of the profession, but how the profession works, and to get as many perspectives as possible.
