# Internship Introduction & About this Page

I selected this internship because I really wanted to be a part of the history and future of this archive. The scope and breadth of this project, as well as its long history, was attractive to me because we have to contend with previous iterations of current technology. The microfilmed documents have created unique problems in creating a digital website that is accessible, and easy to find. In a lot of ways, this project is also the history of the ways archives have had to adapt and shift to make their collections more accessible. I appreciate that sense of history, and the complex work being done for the purposes of discoverability and accessibility, using the tech available over the past fifty years. I really love the complexity of this project, all its moving parts, and the way it has to contend with the ways people have tried to organize and shape this massive amount of archival material. **To use this tool, read through the annotation at the bottom of the image, and click the right arrow to read the next annotation.**

The essay below highlights the work I completed for my internship, presented in the digital format I researched, prototyped, and presented to the Edison Papers Project team. This visual essay tool, called Juncture, will serve as one of the tools used for future exhibitions at the Edison Papers project. It best represents my experience, as it reflects my personal, academic, and employment interests in digital humanities; the flexibility and encouragement I recevied from my team; and the perserverance and learning I developed throughout the semester. There are various features within the essay to explore. The text of the essay is composed of edited sections from the journals submitted throughout the semester. **Please keep in mind that is an open source tool that is still in development, and you may encounter slow loading speeds and bugs throughout. Sections with bullet points have no accompanying image. Images may not necessarily relate to Thomas A. Edison.**

# History & Mission of The Edison Papers Project

The mission of the [Thomas A. Edison Papers Project](https://edison.rutgers.edu/) is to make “the documentary legacy of America’s most prolific inventor and innovator accessible through selective, annotated digital image and book editions. In addition, we disseminate our research through journal and book publications, conference papers, information on our website, media appearances, public lectures, museum collaborations, and educational programs.”[^1] The project is divided into five parts: the digital edition, the book edition, the microfilm collection, the motion picture catalogs, and Edison Miller Family records. The nine volumes of the book edition have been completed; with the tenth forthcoming. The first edition was published in 1989 and most recently  in 2021. The book edition has been compiled and edited by scholars of Edison, including [Dr. Paul Israel](https://edison.rutgers.edu/about/staff?view=article&id=307:paul-israel&catid=28), the current director of the project. The digital edition team is in the process of creating new catalog records and updating the website to include these catalogs.

# Current Project & Internship Responsibiliites 

The current project continues to be led by Dr. Paul Israel, who was part of the reorganization in the 1970s, and under his direction, 227 reels of microfilm have been published (about ⅓ of a million pages), completed in the 1980s. This includes: technical, business, and personal papers, covering the years 1847-1910; a collection of film and equipment catalogs from the early years of motion pictures. The current [Digital Edition](https://edisondigital.rutgers.edu/) has a searchable database with document images, from the original collection, and includes other material from over a hundred outside repositories, representing public and private collections. The next step in the digital edition process is to create sub-sites that focus specifically on various themes, which can help researchers to focus on relevant parts of this enormous collection. The current project is funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Archives. To aid in presevation, a large section of Edison's notebooks were uploaded to the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/search.php?query=subject%3A%22EdisonNotebook%22&and[]=subject%3A%22Thomas+A.+Edison+Papers%22), as a digital repository.

## Responsibilities

My original tasks for the semester were to focus on: metadata management, manipulation, and production; digital image processing and indexing; and finding aids. I will also take part in constructing a new exhibit, based on a currently unpublished collection of Edison’s Pocket Notebooks. For this project, I moved through the various stages of processing, publication, and metadata production to create an exhibit. While I did process the unpublished collection, I did not turn it into an exhibition, an instead made an exhibit based on Edison's son and daughter's activities during World War I. We decided that I would work on the motion picture catalogs and patent collection in the fall. The tasks and deliverables we had identified were:

- Create motion picture catalog records in Omeka-S that point to the RUcore objects (delayed to FALL 2022)
- Create an Archive.org collection for patent PDFs, then create catalog records in Omeka-S that point to the Archive.org object (delayed to FALL 2022)
- Produce 23 pocket notebook PDFs, publish to Archive.org Notebooks collection, then add to Omeka-S notebooks sub-site (COMPLETE)
- Produce exhibit of the new pocket notebook collection; more like a finding aid or book report, with links to related documents / searches in Digital Edition (COMPLETE)
- Explore use of IIIF and linked data to merge metadata, digital objects + exhibit information (COMPLETE)

# Themes of the Internship

## Neutrality

**To activate this feature, roll over the image to see it change.** The Edison Papers Project is an example of documentary editing, which originally, made more of an effort to be neutral. The collected papers of important American figures have shifted over time to include not just the biographical and the psychological, but to include social, political, and economic factors in contextualizing the documents of these figures.  The scholarly journal [Scholarly Editing: The Annual of the Association of Documentary Editing](https://scholarlyediting.org/issues/39/), represents this shift. After a five year hiatus, the most recent edition has a much more specific and thematic organizatio. The authors state that they are “actively seeking to dislodge the single-author model, oral histories and tales, community recovery, creative works of ‘rememory,’ and the decolonizing of artistic works, archives, records, and editions for the discoverability of racialized and underrepresented stories and cultural artifacts”[^2]. During the spring semester I  wrote a lot about the ways in which archives are not neutral; and neither are these documents of Edison’s. I found that we talked about these documents like data points, we never really discussed anything about the content of the documents. We could be talking about anything, anyone’s papers; it’s an image, or a web address, or some text. I found myself feeling as though it’s not really my business what the documents say, or how it might be used, or is being used, except in broad terms like “searchable” and “findable.” I can see how easily someone can become neutral about archives, how being overwhelmed with the organization and the factual, or meta-factual, the actual people, whether in the archives, or those stewarding them, become lost. In the last semester, I felt that I wanted to be more of an activist in advocating for people who had been silenced and under-represented. But now I have seen how easy it is to be neutral, not because it isn't valuable, but because the amount of information you are dealing with is overwhelming, or basically, your job doesn't involve anything that would allow you opportunity to address it. I think that this is a good counter to my activist archivist rage of the previous semester, not that I will lose sight of the human value of archives, but to learn the dynamics of these types of disciplines and professions.

## Flexibility & Adaptation

**To activate this feature, click on the highlighted portion below which will take you to a specific part of the document.** My project, determined at the beginning of the semester, should span the entire work process of the Edison Papers, from unprocessed material to digitally enabled exhibit. However, once I had processed the material, it was unclear how I would address the contents of these objects (they were personal, pocket notebooks that contained Edison’s day-to-day thoughts), without being an Edison scholar. In the meantime, I had reviewed some digital essay tools, and was really impressed by a tool called Juncture, developed by JSTOR labs. I spoke to the team, and everyon was really excited about developing a prototype. After I presented the prototype to the director, we determined it would be difficult to create an exhibit from the pocket notebooks. I felt it was very important that my work contribute to the overall project of the Edison papers, even in a small way.  Through our discussion, we decided that it would be best to use existing essays about Edison and World War I <span data-click-image-zoomto="22,135,568,411"> , because I’m interested in World War I, and create an exhibit using the Juncture tool. So instead of creating an exhibit from the pocket notebooks, I would complete a different exhibit, which still allowed me to complete all the steps of a project, even though the beginning material was not related to the final product. I really appreciated the flexibility of Ben and Paul, and that they wanted me to research and follow up on my own interests, rather than staying on a track that was more difficult, even though we had identified it as the goal of the internship. There is a really good balance of teaching and learning, flexibility and goal-oriented practices in this internship. It has really felt good to be included and to have my ideas listened to and felt part of the project.

# Connections

## ITHAKA & JSTOR in New York, USA

I met with Ron Snyder at JSTOR to discuss this Juncture tool he developed, as a way to create visual essays. Most of the examples are pictorial, and the Edison Papers works mostly with images of text, and I explained that we would like to use the features provided by Juncture to highlight certain parts of the text, and collect different parts of Edison’s documents together into one exhibit, based on a theme or time period. The tool has the ability to be iterative, and exhibits (and its contents) can be shifted to accommodate new information or perspectives. Exhibits through Juncture would also show the use of archival material in developing a historical essay.  This is just the first step in developing this exhibit, as the letters could be connected/contrasted with other experiences and documents from outside the Edison Papers. They could also be adjusted to include more perspectives, as they became available. I was very excited to meet with him. In part because it was such a good meeting that suggested further collaboration with the Edison Papers, but also personally because I have known about JSTOR for so long, and felt a kind of connection to them. I really like the idea of a lean and flexible way of providing access to archival material.

## The Royal Society in London, England

I also met with Dr. Anne McLaughlin at the Royal Society, in London. She currently works on Science in the Making, a digital project with the Royal Society. She took me on a tour of the building and the reading room, which is right off the Mall that leads to Buckingham Palace. She mentioned that when she was first hired for her job, she did not have really any knowledge of coding or digital tools, but learned everything on the job. When we discussed how it is difficult for MI (or MLIS) programs to focus on digital programs, she explained that each archive/library/special collections uses different naming conventions, different systems, and that even if it were to be taught, it would either be obsolete within a couple of years, or it would be too difficult to cover all the possibilities of software or skills that are needed for every possible job. It was encouraging to hear someone who started with very little skill (digitally) to have made her way in a digital role, as a project manager. One of my main concerns has been that I think I don’t know enough, and I need to know more. During my supervisor check-in, I said that I should have researched more, and practiced more coding. But as Anne said, there’s no way to really prepare for more digital skills. I think we settled on, “you look at it again, and again, and again, and again, and you mess with it, see what it does, change it, and over time, you learn something about it.”

# Concluding Thoughts

I think there is an implied power difference in an internship. Sometimes, an intern feels “lucky” to have landed an internship, and feels they must work above and beyond what is asked. And while I do feel lucky to have this internship, it doesn’t mean that the organization is not greatly benefiting from my unpaid and passionate labor. I don’t mean that you shouldn’t take every opportunity to learn. I think it’s a mindset, a perspective I’ve had to remind myself of recently: that my work and perspective is valuable on its own, not just in being recognized by someone else.  I haven’t felt taken advantage of at all, during this internship; I have been  encouraged at every step, and because I was in that place of confidence and security that I’ve been able to reflect on the value of my contributions to the project. And not just simply telling myself “this was good” or even more simply, “no one had a problem with this,” it was also the qualities and gradations of good. What were the strengths, what were the weaknesses, and why were they there? Is it a skill that needed honing? Or was it just a really busy week?  I believe it’s important to value yourself and your contributions, and that the company/organization is benefitting from you and your (free) work and perspective. The point of the internship is to learn, not to know. You aren’t (or shouldn’t be) expected to know how to do something, that’s why you are in an internship, and not a job. When I felt that what I was doing had to be perfect, I reminded myself that I was learning, and it was okay to have mistakes and to improve on earlier work.
