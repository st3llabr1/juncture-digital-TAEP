# History & Mission of The Edison Papers Project

The mission of the Thomas A. Edison Papers Project is to make “the documentary legacy of America’s most prolific inventor and innovator accessible through selective, annotated digital image and book editions. In addition, we disseminate our research through journal and book publications, conference papers, information on our website, media appearances, public lectures, museum collaborations, and educational programs.” The project is divided into five parts: the digital edition, the book edition, the microfilm collection, the motion picture catalogs, and Edison Miller Family records. The nine volumes of the book edition have been completed; with the tenth forthcoming. The first edition was published in 1989 and most recently  in 2021. They are available to read on Project Muse, covering the years 1847-1889. The book edition has been compiled and edited by scholars of Edison, including Dr. Israel, the current director of the project. The motion picture catalogs are developed from the print guide, published in 1985, and while there are PDFs for the different catalogs, they are hosted on RUCore through Rutgers Libraries, rather than on the Edison digital edition site. The digital edition team is in the process of creating new catalog records and updating the website to include these catalogs.

# Current Project & Internship Responsibiliites 

The current project is led by Dr. Paul Israel, who was part of the reorganization in the 1970s, and under his direction, 227 reels of microfilm have been published (about ⅓ of a million pages), completed in the 1980s. This includes: technical, business, and personal papers, covering the years 1847-1910; a collection of film and equipment catalogs from the early years of motion pictures. The current digital edition has a searchable database with document images, from the original collection, and includes other material from outside repositories. The purpose of this project is to make the works of Edison accessible through “selective, annotated, digital image and book edition.”

Completed in 2008, the corresponding collections have been uploaded to the Internet Archive as a repository for the digital site. Most of these documents were taken from the archive at Thomas Edison National Historical Park in West Orange, New Jersey. This collection also includes documents from over a hundred outside repositories, both public and private collections. The next step in the digital edition process is to create a sub-site that focuses specifically on Edison’s notebooks, called the Notebook Collection, which can help researchers to focus on smaller subsets of this enormous collection.

The current project is funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Archives. It has several components.  Most recently, all the reels with notebooks were uploaded to archive.org, the Internet Archive, as a digital repository. We are now in the process of transferring the notebooks from the digital edition site to a new Omeka-S subsite, which will include a virtual reading room, and integrate the Internet Archive viewer. Additionally, images from the microfilm are processed and then mapped to document identifiers before being uploaded to the digital edition. These are the major components of the project, however, there are smaller parts such as: transcription of documents, developing exhibits, finding aids, series notes, and an integrated digital edition. The overall goal is to fully publish all parts of the notebook collection, include links to each archive.org document, and to provide an accessible collection with transcriptions, reading room, and new exhibits. 

## Responsibilities

My tasks for the semester will focus on: metadata management, manipulation, and production; digital image processing and indexing; and finding aids. I will also take part in constructing a new exhibit, based on a currently unpublished collection of Edison’s Pocket Notebooks. For this project, I will move through the various stages of processing, publication, and metadata production to create an exhibit. 

The tasks and deliverables we identified are:
- Create motion picture catalog records in Omeka-S that point to the RUcore objects
- Create an Archive.org collection for patent PDFs, then create catalog records in Omeka-S that point to the Archive.org object
- Produce 23 pocket notebook PDFs (Monica will train), publish to Archive.org Notebooks collection, then add to Omeka-S notebooks sub-site
- Produce exhibit of the new pocket notebook collection (more like a finding aid or book report, with links to related documents / searches in Digital Edition)
- Explore use of IIIF and linked data to merge metadata, digital objects + exhibit information
